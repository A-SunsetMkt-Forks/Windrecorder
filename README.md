# QuickStart
- Get ffmpeg.exe and place under Windrecorder folder.
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Starting recording screen: `Python recordScreen.py`
  - **NOTE:** This function is crude and can only be run and terminated manually at present. Before recording, you need to adjust your screen resolution and block recording time in config.json, currently the default is 3840x2160, 60 seconds.
- Query and update database through webui: `python -m streamlit run webui.py`
